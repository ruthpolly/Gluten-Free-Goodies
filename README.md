To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, recipes and sign up). To allow a good user experience of the site, the links are moved to below the logo, allowing the navigation bar to remain uncluttered. 

  * A footer which contains social media icon links to instagram, facebook, teitter and youtube.

It is important to make websites as accessible as possible. This was achieved by:

2. Find the repository for the project, Gluten Free-Goodies.
3. Click on the Settings link.
4. Click on the Pages link in the navigation bar to the left.
5. In the Source section, choose main from the drop down select branch menu. Select Root from the drop down select folder menu.
6. Click Save. Your live Github Pages site will be deployed at the URL shown.

### Local Development


## Testing

Testing was repeated regularly during construction of the website. Chrome developer tools was used to identify and troubleshoot issues.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

* The paragraphs in the information section were too wide across the desktop screen.
* The information and directions sections height values resulted in a block of blank space below them when screen size was reduced.
* Flexbox was not used to make the website responsive.
* The background colour of the navigation links did not stand out enough when links were hovered over.

The Following items were brought up when I submitted my site to peer code review on slack.

* The nav links get too close to the logo when the screen size is reduced to 950px, and then are off center and out of line with the logo when screen size is reduced futher.
* There is a white space beneath the footer on the main page when on a mobile device.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

* [Index Page HTML]()
* [Recipe Page HTML]()
* [Sign Up Page HTML]()
* [Confirmation Page HTML]()
* [style.css CSS]()

### Solved Bugs

1. The navbar would lose its alignment when on smaller devices, The navigation links would migrate, with the home link falling underneath the others. I found an answer to this on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71403990/how-to-create-a-navbar-using-flexbox). This solved the issue, as well as reducing the letter-spacing for the navigation links, and font size for the header.

2. The information section and recipe directions section resulted in a blank space beneath them when screen size was reduced. This was solved by removing all height values for the sections (I should not have included them to begin with).

3. The center cookie image on the recipes page pulled focus from the ingredients when on a smaller screen device. From a user perspective, most recipe sites have pages of text/images/advertisements to scroll through before reaching the recipe. I wanted this to be easy to find and read, without any distractions when using a smaller screen. The solution was to use flex box to move the image to below the ingredients.

4. The cover text over the hero image was too large for the hero image when viewing from a smaller screen size. To utilise the space above the image, I moved the cover text on top of the main image to improve the user experience. I did this by centering the cover text using margin 0 auto.

5. When hovering over the navigation links, the background color only highlights the text itself. For accessibility reasons it would be prefferable for a bigger area of the background colour. This was done by adding padding to the hover pseudo class for the navigation menu.

6. The information section was not centered when screen size was reduced. This was solved by using the margin 0 auto value.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow me to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

#### Index Page

Initial lighthouse testing :
[Lighthouse Testing for Desktop Home Page - Test 1](/documentation/lighthouse-desktop-home-test.png) ~
[Lighthouse Testing for Mobile Home Page - Test 1](/documentation/lighthouse-mobile-home-test.png)

Suggestions:

1. serve images in next-gen formats. Lighthouse suggests using image formats such as WebP & AVIF to improve compression and lead to faster downloads and less data consumption. 

Final lighthouse testing:

![Final Lighthouse Testing for Desktop Index Page](/documentation/lighthouse-desktop-home-test2.PNG)
![Final Lighthouse Testing for Mobile Index Page](/documentation/lighthouse-mobile-home-test2.PNG)

1. Result:  Image was converted to webp but did not increase score much, time constraints inhibited my chance to use [Tiny PNG](tiny.png.com) to compress it further. 

#### Recipe Page

Suggestions:

1. Serve images in next-gen formats. Lighthouse suggests using image formats such as WebP & AVIF to improve compression and lead to faster downloads and less data consumption. I have converted the logo to webp format using Birme.

2. H3 element in the form is not semantic.

Final lighthouse testing:

### Full Testing

To fully test my website I used several browsers (google chrome, safari, mozilla firefox) and devices (HP laptop, lenovo monitor, iPad Mini, Iphone 11 and iPhone 13).

I checked each page using google chrome developer tools to make sure they were responsive on different screen sizes.

Links.

1. Test every link on the index page. Links all worked as expected and all links leading to an external page opened correctly in a new browser tab.
2. Test every link on the recipes page. Links all worked as expected and all links leading to an external page opened correctly in a new browser tab.
3. Test every link on the sign up page. Links all worked as expected and all links leading to an external page opened correctly in a new browser tab.
4. Test every link on the confirmation page. Links all worked as expected and all links leading to an external page opened correctly in a new browser tab.

Sign Up Form.

1. Test the sign up form. I attempted to submit the form before filling in any input fields. The form worked as expected and instructed users to fill in the first name field. Then filled in the first name field and attempted to submit the form. Once again the form worked and instructed the user to fill out the last name field. When I filled out the first name and last name fields and clicked to submit the form, it worked correctly and instructed the user to fill in the email field. I completed the names and email field and tried to submit the form. The form then opened the confirmation page in the same browser window, before refreshing the browser after 10 seconds and returning to the home page.
2. I attempted to submit the form with just the email address - the form instructs the user to fill in each of the name fields. I filled out the names and email fields and tried to submit the form. The form then opened the confirmation page in the same browser window, before refreshing the browser after 10 seconds and returning to the home page.
6. I attempted to submit the form without any information input. The form instructs the user to fill in the first name field. It proceeds to ask the user to complete the last name field and then the email field. The form is then able to ne submitted and will open the confirmation page in the same browser window, before refreshing the browser after 10 seconds and returning to the home page.
