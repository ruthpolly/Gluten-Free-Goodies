The website has three pages, which are accessible from the navigation menu (home, recipes and sign up). 

* All Pages on the website have:

  * A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is the Gluten-Free Goodies logo which navigates to home. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, recipes and sign up). To allow a good user experience of the site, the links are moved to below the logo, allowing the navigation bar to remain uncluttered. 

  * A footer which contains social media icon links to instagram, facebook, teitter and youtube.

  * Hero Image.
  The hero image contains cover text stating what the website will provide

### Accessibility

It is important to make websites as accessible as possible. This was achieved by:

### Local Development


## Testing

Testing was repeated regularly during construction of the website. Chrome developer tools was used to identify and troubleshoot issues.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

* 
* 
* 
* 

The Following items were brought up when I submitted my site to peer code review on slack.

* 
* 

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

### Solved Bugs

1. The navbar would lose its alignment when on smaller devices, The navigation links would migrate, with the home link falling underneath the others. I found an answer to this on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71403990/how-to-create-a-navbar-using-flexbox). This solved the issue, as well as reducing the letter-spacing for the navigation links, and font size for the header.
2. The information section and recipe directions section requires a larger height in px when the screen sixe is reduces to 320px, but results in a large blank space when screen size is increased to 600px.
..............

3. The center cookie image on the recipes page pulled focus from the ingredients when on a smaller screen device. From a user perspective, most recipe sites have pages of text/images/advertisements to scroll through before reaching the recipe. I wanted this to be easy to find and read, without any distractions when using a smaller screen. The solution was to hide the image when viewing the recipe on a smaller device.

4. The cover text over the hero image was too large for the hero image when viewing from a smaller screen size. To utilise the space above the image, I moved the cover text over the main image to improve the user experience. I did this by centering the cover text using margin 0 auto.

5. When hovering over the navigation links, the background color only highlights the text itself. For accessibility reasons it would be prefferable for the whole height of the bar behind the link to transform with the hover pseudo class.

6. The nav bar and the foor lack definition. With such a pale color as a background, extra definition can be added by including a border, the same shade as the text in those areas.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow me to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

#### Index Page

Initial lighthouse testing :
[Lighthouse Testing for Desktop Index Page - Test 1](docs/testing/lighthouse/indexdesktop.png) ~
[Lighthouse Testing for Mobile Index Page - Test 1](docs/testing/lighthouse/indexmobile.png)

Suggestions:

1. serve images in next-gen formats. Lighthouse suggests using image formats such as WebP & AVIF to improve compression and lead to faster downloads and less data consumption. I have now converted the logo and slide images to webp format using Birme.

Final lighthouse testing:

#### Books Page

Initial lighthouse testing:

### Full Testing

To fully test my website I performed the following testing using a number of browsers (google chrome, safari, mozilla firefox) and devices (Macbook Pro 14 inch, iPhone 13 pro).

I also went through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that they responsive on all different screen sizes.

Links.

1. Test each link on the index page. Each link worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate browser tab.
2. Test each link on the books page. Each link worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate browser tab.
3. Test each link on the contact us page. Each link worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate browser tab.
4. Test each link on the thank you page. Each link worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate browser tab.
5. Test each link on the 404 page. Each link worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate tab.

Contact Us Form.

1. Test the contact us form. I tried to submit the form without filling in any input fields. The form worked as expected and instructed users to fill in the first name field. Then filled in the first name field and tried to submit the form. Again the form worked and instructed the user to fill out the last name field. I filled out the first name and last name forms and tried to submit the form. The form worked correctly and asked the user to fill in the email field. I filled out the names and email field and tried to submit the form. The form then opens the thank you page in the same browser window.
2. I tried to submit the form with only an email address - the form directs the user to fill in the name field. I filled out the name and email fields and tried to submit the form. The form then directs the user to fill out the textarea field. I filled in the name, email and textarea field and submitted the form. The form then opens the thank you page in the same browser window.
3. I tried to submit the form with just the instagram username field filled in and the form directed me to fill in the name field. I filled in the name and instagram username fields and tried again to submit. The form asks the user to fill in the email field. I filled in the name, instagram username and email field and tried to submit. The form asks the user to fill in the textarea field. I filled out the name, instagram username, email and textarea fields and submitted the form. the form then opens the thank you page in the same browser window.
4. I tried to submit the form with only the textarea field filled in. The form directs the user to fill in the name field. I filled in the name and textarea field and submitted the form. The form directs the user to fill in the email field. I filled in the name, email and textarea fields and submitted the form. The form then opens the thank you page in the same browser window.
5. I selected one of the checkboxes and tried to submit the form. The form directs me to fill in the name field. I filled in the name field and the form directs the user to fill in the email field. I filled in the name and email fields and tried to submit the form. The form directs the user to fill in the textarea field. Once I filled in the name, email and textarea fields with a checkbox selected the form then opens the thank you page in the same browser window.
6. I tried submitting the form without any information filled in. The form directs the user to fill in the name field. It then goes on to ask the user to complete the email and textarea fields if they are not filled out. The form can then be submitted and will open the thank you page in the same browser window.
